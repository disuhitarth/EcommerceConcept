# ⚠️ Gemini API Key Revoked

## Issue

The Google Gemini API key was exposed in our conversation and has been automatically revoked by Google for security reasons.

**Error message:**
```
Your API key was reported as leaked. Please use another API key.
```

## What This Means

The AI image generation features will not work until you generate a new API key:
- ❌ Text-to-image generation
- ❌ AI background removal
- ❌ AI super resolution
- ❌ Image editing with AI
- ❌ Auto-fill from images
- ❌ Text optimization

## How to Fix

### 1. Delete the Leaked Key

1. Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey)
2. Find the key starting with: `AIzaSyCoBOj4Q0yTiAMldCzJfjYnTaWzrFioABc`
3. Click **Delete** to remove it

### 2. Generate a New Key

1. In Google AI Studio, click **"Create API Key"**
2. Select your Google Cloud project
3. Copy the new key (starts with `AIzaSy...`)

### 3. Update Your Configuration

1. Open `config/gemini.js`
2. Replace the old key with your new key:
   ```javascript
   apiKey: 'YOUR_NEW_API_KEY_HERE',
   ```
3. Save the file

### 4. Test It

1. Visit http://localhost:3000/add-product.html
2. Try generating an AI image
3. Should work now!

## Security Best Practices

To prevent this in the future:

### ✅ DO:
- Keep API keys in `config/gemini.js` (already gitignored)
- Never share screenshots with API keys visible
- Never paste API keys in public chats
- Rotate keys periodically
- Use environment variables for production

### ❌ DON'T:
- Share API keys in conversations
- Commit API keys to GitHub
- Post API keys in screenshots
- Use the same key across multiple projects

## Current Status

- ✅ Authentication system: **Working**
- ✅ Product creation: **Working**
- ✅ Shopify integration: **Working**
- ❌ AI features: **Needs new API key**

## Alternative: Use Backend Environment Variable

For better security, you can move the Gemini API key to the backend:

1. Add to `.env`:
   ```
   GEMINI_API_KEY=your_new_key_here
   ```

2. Update `server.js` to proxy Gemini requests
3. Frontend calls backend instead of Gemini directly
4. API key never exposed in browser

---

**The authentication system works perfectly!** Just need a new Gemini key for AI features.
